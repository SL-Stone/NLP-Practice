##### Some notes...

When you want to learn some new knowledge, technology, or fresh ideas, you start to learn about many theoretical things from a variety of books, blogs, tutorials, and staff, then all you have to do is to code, to practice, which will strengthen your memory and through this process, you might find something new, face with some difficult issues, deal with them, break your old and incorrect opinions, absorb fresh and comprehensive ideas.

**More coding, More thinking.**

Pick a field-related dataset. Code a model or an algorithm. Use the data samples to evaluate your products. Time permitting, compare the model to other algorithms in this field.
